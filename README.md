# Deep Learning Chatbot that can talk to humans
Using Google Text-to-speech library to convert text to speech so that we can talk to the bot.
The code could be run on both Desktop or virtual environment like Google Colab.
We are working on this project to make a chatbot that understands humans' emotion and could talk to us like a real human friend. Our mission is to fill the gap of daily communication within and after the pandemic.
